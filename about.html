					Since he was young, Joshua has always enjoyed working in the kitchen with his mother. From brownies for his elementary school class to homemade pasta with his cousin, he has had a love of the culinary arts for
					as long as he can remember. Naturally from this came an interest in cooking competion shows, such as Holiday Baking Championship and Chopped. Thus, when offered information on applications to The Food Network's Rachel Vs. Guy Kids Cookoff
					he immediately sought to apply. Unfortunately, he was not accepted, however he persevered and continued to hone his skills. One year later the casting studio reached out once more to offer him a chance to apply, this time to Food Network's Chopper Junior.
					He siezed the chance and was ultimately accepted. Joshua trained for the following months under the Chef Amanda Varnell, formerly of Dish t' Pass, and finally he and his family were flown up to New York for filming.
					<br>Joshua was featured on Chopped Junior Season 3 Episode 8 titled Curry Hurry.
