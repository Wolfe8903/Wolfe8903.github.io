						This Seven Segment Display Clock was almost entirely 3D printed and was fully assembled by myself. 
						All of the original design work was completed by JBV Creative (Engineezy). Each segment is rotated by a rack and pinion system in which the rack is driven forward by a camshaft in the rear. 
						Each of the four camshafts are rotated individually by a motor mounted to the module. One of the biggest challenges in this project was making the gear teeth between the motor and camshaft mesh correctly. 
						I was ultimately forced to make several modifications to the original model, such as entirely remodeling the gears to be herringbone rather than spur, in order to get
						all four modules working consistently. The time is tracked by a Real Time Clock module (RTC) which features its own power supply in order to keep time even when the arduino nano is powered down. This module was
						entirely unfamiliar to me and posed many challenges in proper setup.
						Lastly, just to clean up the electronics, I opted to redesign the base of the whole system to feature mounting points for both the servo driver board and RTC.
